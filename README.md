# Project description: Flashcard-o-matic

### Summary

Flashcard-o-matic is a web application that allows users to create, edit, and study decks of flashcards using React function components. This project was created as my front-end capstone project for Thinkful's Software Engineering program.

### Objective
A front-end project designed to test my ability to work with rendering and state management using React.

By successfully completing this project, I demonstrated the following capabilities:

- Installing packages via NPM
- Running tests from the command line
- Writing React function components
- Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
- Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
- Debugging React code through console output and using the VS Code debugger

### Technologies

JavaScript, React, React Hooks, React Router, HTML, CSS

### Installation

1. Fork / clone this repository.
1. Run `npm install`.

Use `npm start` to run the application.

Set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable to the base url for the API.

If `API_BASE_URL` is not set, a default value of `http://localhost:5000` is used.
